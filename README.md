# Hi! 

I'm Ali

You can find me everywhere online at *@endingwithali*. 

I work fulltime as a backend engineer writing Golang at ~~[REDACTED]~~, and am the host, producer, and writer of [ThreatWire](https://youtube.com/@ha5k), a weekly show about trending cybersecurity news.


You can watch me write code live almost everyday at [twitch.tv/endingwithali](https://twitch.tv/endingwithali)
